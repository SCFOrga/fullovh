# Front OVH Processing

This project is designed to use the frames caught by @Akariiinnn and to put them in a Website by some charts. You can only use it and exploit the data if you a apart of the SCFOrga or you are a technician at the LGM in Meylan . You have some main files that you can use for inspiration or something else :

- `Accueil/testultime.html` : This is the main file of the Website : The Home Page. On this template, you have 3 slot for some data charts but you can create more slots.
- `LogIN/Log.hmtl` : A cool design for a login page ( You have pretty the same thing for the Sign In one at `inscription/inscription.html` )
